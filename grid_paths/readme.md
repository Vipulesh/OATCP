## Problem Statement

The problem asks for the number of paths from the upper-left square to the lower-right square in a grid. The grid may contain traps, and it is not allowed to move to a square with a trap. You can only move right or down.

### Memoization Solution

The commented-out `dp` function in the code is a memoization solution. It uses a top-down approach, starting from the destination cell and moving to the start cell. It uses the `check` array to determine if a cell is reachable and the `paths` array to store the number of paths to each cell. The `paths` array is initially filled with -1, indicating that the number of paths to each cell has not yet been calculated. The `dp` function is then called with the coordinates of the destination cell, and it recursively calls itself with the coordinates of the cells above and to the left of the current cell, adding up the number of paths to these cells.

### Tabulation Solution

The tabulation solution uses a bottom-up approach, starting from the start cell and moving to the destination cell. It uses the `check` array to determine if a cell is reachable and the `dp` array to store the number of paths to each cell. The `dp` array is initially filled with 0, except for the start cell, which is set to 1. The code then iterates over each cell in the grid, and if the cell is reachable, it adds the number of paths to the cells above and to the left of the current cell to the number of paths to the current cell.
