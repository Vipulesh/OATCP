## Introduction
This C++ program is designed to form the largest number possible from the given array of integers. It sorts the array elements in such a way that the concatenated string of any two elements forms the larger number.

## How to Use
To use this program, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:
4. Run the compiled executable:
5. Enter the integers separated by spaces.
6. Press Enter.
7. The program will output the largest number that can be formed from the given integers.

## Functionality
The `largestNumber` function takes a vector of integers as input and sorts them in such a way that the concatenated string of any two elements forms the larger number. It uses a custom comparison function `compare` to determine the order of elements during sorting.
