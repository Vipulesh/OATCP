1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:
4. Run the compiled executable:
5. Enter the input number.
6. Enter the value of K.
7. The program will output the smallest possible number formed after removing K digits.

## Functionality
The `removeKdigits` function takes a string representing a number and an integer K as input. It removes K digits from the number to form the smallest possible number. It uses a stack to maintain the digits and removes digits based on certain conditions to minimize the resulting number.
