## Introduction
This program is designed to find the maximum product subarray in a given list of integers. The code uses a straightforward approach to solve the problem without explicitly applying dynamic programming techniques.

## Code Explanation
- The variable `n` is read from the input, which represents the number of elements in the array.
- A vector `nums` is declared to store the integers.
- The input integers are read into the `nums` vector.
- The variable `maxi` is initialized to the smallest integer to keep track of the maximum product.
- The variable `prd` is initialized to 1 to store the current product.
- A loop iterates through the `nums` vector, updating the `prd` with the product of the elements modulo `mod`.
- The `maxi` is updated with the maximum value between `maxi` and `prd`.
- If `n` is zero, the output is zero; otherwise, the maximum product is printed.

## Note on Dynamic Programming
- While the code does not use dynamic programming in its current form, a DP approach can be implemented to optimize the solution for overlapping subproblems and to avoid recomputation.
- A typical DP solution would involve creating a table to store the results of subproblems and building up the solution using these stored results.
- The DP approach would be particularly useful if the problem required the computation of multiple queries for maximum product subarrays.

## Conclusion
The provided code offers a solution to the maximum product subarray problem using a simple iterative approach. For larger inputs or multiple queries, considering a dynamic programming approach could lead to more efficient solutions.
